## Sources of Data 

1. From the program itself: Data written directly in some code
2. From the ```UI```: Data input from other users
3. External sources: Data fetched for example we store collection of data in data structures


## Type Data Structures and Use

### Arrays

- Arrays used when you need ordered lists of values (might contain duplicates).
- Array used when you want to manipulate data

### Sets

- Sets can be used when you need to work with unique values
- When high performance is really important 
- To remove duplcates from arrays

### Objects

- Objects are used when you want tp write and access values with ```.``` and ```[]```.

### Maps

- Maps are used to iterate 
- Maps can have any data types
- Easy to compute size
