# JAVASCRIPT
 
 ## DEFINITION OF JAVASCRIPT
- JavaScript is the most dynamic computer programming language used to program the behavior of web pages. 

## ABOUT JAVASCRIPT

 - It is a lightweight and most commonly used as a part of the web pages with implementations that allow client-side script to interact with the user and make dynamic pages. 
 - JavaScript is a well interpreted programming language with object-oriented capabilities.
 
 ## ADVANTAGES OF JAVASCRIPT

 - Less server interaction meaning that they can be validation of user input before sending the page off to the server and it helps save server traffic (Less load on your server).
 - Immediate feedback to the visitors meaning that visitors should not have to wait for a page reload to see if they have forgotten to enter something.
 - Increased interactivity meaning that an interface can be created which reacts when the user hovers over them with the mouse or activates them through keyboard.
 - JavaScript has a rich interface where you can use it to include such items as drag and drop components and sliders to give a nice interface to one's site visitors.

 ## DISADVANTAGES OF JAVASCRIPT

 - JavaScript can not be treated as a full fledged programming language because it lacks the some important features like:
  - Javascript client side does not allow the reading or writing of files(This has been kept for security reasons).
  - JavaScript can not be used for networking applications because there is no such support available. 
  - Javascript does not have any multithreading or muitiprocessor capabilities.

  ## WHERE TO PLACE JAVASCRIPT

  - JavaScript can be implemented using statements that placed within the  ```<script></script>``` in the HTML tags in a web page.
  - JavaScript can either be placed within the ```<head></head>``` or ```<body></body>``` tags.
  - The Script tag in JavaScript considers two important attributes such as Language and Type.

  ## JAVASCRIPT SYNTAX 

  - JavaScript syntax is the set of rules on how JavaScript programs can be constructed.
  - JavaScript syntax defines two types of values; ```Fixed values``` and ```Variable values```.
  - Fixed values are called Literals while Variable values are called Variables.
  ~ There are two important JavaScript Literals which are Numbers and Strings.
     - Numbers are written with or without decimals.
     - For example : ```10``` or ```10.5```
     - Strings are text which are written within double or single quotes.
     - For example : ```"Car"``` or ```'Carrots are nice'```.

 - JavaScript Variables are variables used to store data values.
 - JavaScript uses the keywords var, let and const to declare variables.
   - Var is a variable that can be updated and re-declared within its scope
   - let is a variables that can be updated but not re-declared
   - const is a variable that can neither be updated nor re-declared
 - An equal sign (=) is used to assign values to variables.
   - For example:
   
                     let x;
                      x = 10
   
   - x is defined as a variable. Then, x is assigned (given) the value 10.
